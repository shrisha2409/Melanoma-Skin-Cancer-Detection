# Skin Cancer Detection using Custom CNN
> A project to build a custom CNN model to accurately detect melanoma from skin images.

## Problem statement :  

- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information

- This project focuses on the detection of skin cancer using image data.
- The project background involves leveraging machine learning and image processing techniques to detect melanoma in skin images
- This project addresses the business challenge of developing a reliable automated system to assist dermatologists in diagnosing skin cancer, aiming to reduce manual effort and enhance early detection rates
- The dataset used is from the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) archive, consisting of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases.
- The dataset includes images of various skin conditions, such as Actinic keratosis, Basal cell carcinoma, Dermatofibroma, Melanoma, Nevus, Pigmented benign keratosis, Seborrheic keratosis, Squamous cell carcinoma, and Vascular lesions

## Conclusions
- The custom CNN model achieved a high accuracy in detecting melanoma.
- Data augmentation significantly improved the model's performance and helped in handling class imbalances.
- Using a custom model instead of a pre-trained model provided insights into the model architecture and its performance.
- The project demonstrates the potential of AI in medical diagnosis and the importance of handling class imbalances in medical datasets.
